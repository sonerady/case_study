In this project, I tried to avoid using ready-made libraries as much as possible. I even used Carousel and Carousel Map Point with just plain javascript and css.

For state management in the case, I used the "Redux" library. I carefully separated each redux dependency into its own folder.

Each component in the project has its own style file. This prevents clutter and mess in the css. I used modular-style css and scss in the CSS part.
